# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Overview

This project is part of the curriculum and aims to reinforce your understanding of fundamental C programming concepts such as variables, arithmetic operators, logical operators, if statements, else statements, relational operators, and while loops. Additionally, you'll explore topics related to data types, variable declaration, and ASCII character sets.

## Project Timeline

- Start Date: September 8, 2023, 6:00 AM
- End Date: September 9, 2023, 6:00 AM
- Checker Release: September 8, 2023, 12:00 PM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use arithmetic operators.
- Grasp the concepts of logical operators (boolean operators) and their application.
- Familiarize yourself with relational operators and their usage.
- Identify TRUE and FALSE values in C.
- Work with boolean operators effectively.
- Utilize if and if...else statements for decision-making in your code.
- Practice proper commenting in your code.
- Declare variables of types char, int, and unsigned int.
- Assign values to variables.
- Display variable values using `printf`.
- Implement and use while loops.
- Work with variables within while loops.
- Print variables using `printf`.
- Understand the ASCII character set.
- Recognize the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64.

## Requirements

- **Editors:** You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs for your code.
- **Compilation:** All your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`. Use the following compilation flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **File Formatting:** Ensure that all your files end with a newline character.
- **README:** Create a README.md file at the root of your project folder to provide project information.
- **Compilation Errors:** There should be no compilation errors or warnings.
- **System Calls:** Avoid using system calls in your code.
- **Coding Style:** Follow the Betty coding style. Your code will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

## Important Notes

- **Plagiarism:** It's essential to come up with your own solutions to meet the project's objectives. Avoid copying or pasting someone else's work, as plagiarism is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the program.
- **Publishing Content:** Do not publish any content related to this project.
- **Errors and Warnings:** Ensure your code compiles without errors or warnings.
- **gcc Flags:** Understand the purpose of the `-m32` and `-m64` gcc flags.
