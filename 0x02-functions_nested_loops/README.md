 - Functions, Nested Loops Project

## Overview

This is a C programming project focused on teaching various concepts related to C programming, including nested loops, functions, function prototypes, scope of variables, compiler flags, and header files. The project aims to help you gain a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

## Project Details

- **Project Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** September 12, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** September 13, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** September 12, 2023, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:

1. Understand and use nested loops.
2. Define and use functions.
3. Differentiate between function declaration and definition.
4. Understand the concept of a prototype.
5. Understand the scope of variables.
6. Familiarize yourself with GCC compiler flags like `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
7. Understand header files and how to use them with `#include`.

## Requirements

### General

1. Editors Allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
2. Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
3. Code files should end with a newline character.
4. Mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
5. Code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
6. Global variables are not allowed.
7. Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
8. Prohibited use of standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., except for `_putchar`.
9. Allowed to use `_putchar`, but you don't need to push `_putchar.c` as it will be provided.
10. Prototypes for all functions and the `_putchar` function should be included in a header file named `main.h`. Don't forget to push your header file.
11. No content of this project should be published.
12. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and start working on the tasks related to nested loops, functions, and other concepts mentioned in the learning objectives. Ensure that your code adheres to the provided requirements and restrictions.
