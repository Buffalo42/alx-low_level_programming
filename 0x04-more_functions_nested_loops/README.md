# C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
This C project focuses on nested loops, functions, function prototypes, and header files. It emphasizes the use of gcc compiler flags and adherence to coding standards. 

## Requirements
- Create C source files that compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with gcc and the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Follow the Betty coding style.
- Limit each file to a maximum of 5 functions.
- Avoid using the standard library, except for _putchar.
- Provide a README.md file with project details.

## Usage
Compile your code with the specified flags and execute the resulting program.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain proficiency in nested loops.
- Develop modular code using functions.
- Understand function declaration vs. definition.
- Create function prototypes in header files.
- Manage variable scope in C.
- Use gcc compiler flags effectively.
- Work with header files and #include directives.
