Project Title: C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Description:
This C programming project focuses on fundamental concepts such as pointers, arrays, and strings. By working through the tasks in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of these essential topics in C programming.

Learning Objectives:
1. Understand what pointers are and how to use them effectively.
2. Master the concept of arrays and learn how to manipulate them.
3. Differentiate between pointers and arrays, understanding when to use each.
4. Gain proficiency in working with strings and performing string manipulations.
5. Explore the scope of variables and understand variable visibility and lifetime.

Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All code files must end with a new line.
- A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- You are not permitted to use global variables.
- Each code file can contain no more than 5 functions.
- Do not use the standard library; functions like printf, puts, etc., are not allowed.
- You can use _putchar, but you don't need to include *_putchar.c as we will provide our own during compilation.
- Prototypes for all functions and the _putchar function should be included in a header file named main.h, which you must push.
- Your code must not contain any plagiarism, and copying someone else's work is strictly prohibited.

Project Execution:
- Project will start Sep 18, 2023, 6:00 AM, and must end by Sep 19, 2023, 6:00 AM.
- Checker was released at Sep 18, 2023, 6:00 AM.
- An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

Submission Guidelines:
- You must provide solutions to the project tasks independently to meet the learning objectives.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Follow the provided project instructions and coding guidelines meticulously.

Project Files:
- Project tasks and code files are not included in this README. You will work on these tasks using your preferred code editor (vi, vim, emacs).
- The main.c files mentioned in the project description are provided as examples for testing your functions but do not need to be pushed to your repository.

Conclusion:
This project is designed to help you develop a strong foundation in C programming by focusing on pointers, arrays, and strings. It is essential to follow the guidelines, complete the tasks independently, and adhere to coding standards. Through this project, you will gain valuable experience and knowledge to become a proficient C programmer.
