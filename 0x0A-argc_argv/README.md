# Project README - C argc, argv

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and utilizing command-line arguments passed to a C program. You will learn how to work with `argc` and `argv`, two essential elements for processing command-line input in C. Additionally, you will explore the use of `__attribute__((unused))` and `(void)` to handle unused variables or parameters in your functions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

### General
- How to use arguments passed to your program.
- Knowledge of two prototypes of `main` and when to use each.
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Requirements
### General
- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`).
- All files should end with a newline.
- A mandatory `README.md` file at the project's root.
- Code style must adhere to the Betty style guide.
- Avoid global variables.
- Limit each file to no more than 5 functions.
- Include the prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` in your header file named `main.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- Allowed use of the standard library.

## Plagiarism and Copyright
- Avoid plagiarism and do not publish any project content.
- Strictly follow plagiarism rules to stay in the program.
