"Requirements - C","- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs - Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 - All files end with a new line - Mandatory README.md file at the root - Code should use the Betty style, checked with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl - No global variables - No more than 5 functions per file - No use of standard library functions (e.g., printf, puts) - Allowed to use _putchar - Prototypes of all functions and _putchar in main.h - Don't push _putchar.c"
"Requirements - Bash","- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs - Testing on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - All files end with a new line - The first line of all files should be #!/bin/bash - README.md file describing each script - All files must be executable"
"How to Use","1. Clone the repository. 2. Run Bash scripts in numerical order (e.g., ./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh). 3. Follow README instructions for each script to understand its purpose and expected output."
"Note","- Do not push _putchar.c as it won't be considered. - Ensure all files end with a new line. - Adhere to specified requirements to avoid issues during testing."
