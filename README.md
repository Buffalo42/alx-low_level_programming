# C Programming Project

This repository contains a collection of C programming code and shell scripts created to demonstrate an understanding of C programming concepts. The project encompasses a variety of tasks, including code samples and scripts, designed to fulfill the requirements and learning objectives specified in the project description.

## Contents

- C source code files showcasing C programming concepts and best practices.
- Shell scripts, each containing exactly two lines, with the first line being `#!/bin/bash`.
- Documentation and README files to explain the purpose and usage of the project.

## Learning Objectives

The project aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand why C programming is considered awesome.
- Learn about the creators of the C programming language, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Explore the compilation process of C programs using `gcc`.
- Familiarize yourself with fundamental concepts such as the entry point, `main` function, and printing text.
- Gain knowledge about program size using the `sizeof` operator.
- Comply with the official C coding style using `betty-style` and `betty-doc`.
- Learn how to include standard library headers in source code.
- Understand how the `main` function influences the return value of a program.

## Requirements

- C code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options.
- Shell scripts should be exactly two lines long and use `#!/bin/bash`.
- The project should adhere to the Betty coding style.
- There should be no errors or warnings during compilation.
- All files should end with a new line.
